      <h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m someone who thrives on solving problems, connecting with people, and making things run smoother â€” whether it's helping a customer navigate a tech issue or ensuring data is entered with precision.</p>

    <p>For over three years, Iâ€™ve worked behind the scenes in the BPO industry, wearing multiple hats â€” customer service representative, technical support specialist, and data entry expert. Iâ€™ve supported clients from industries like healthcare and telecommunications, communicating through calls, emails, and live chat. Each interaction has taught me the value of patience, clarity, and being the calm in someone else's storm.</p> 
    
    <p>I believe great support goes beyond scripts â€” itâ€™s about understanding people, adapting fast, and always staying one step ahead. Thatâ€™s what I bring to every role, every project, every day.</p>
